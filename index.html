<h1>Welcome to the Tripathy Lab!</h1> 

<br>
<p>We aim to develop a multi-scale understanding of brain cell type diversity, bridging genetics and gene expression with cell and circuit physiology. We develop machine learning and statistical methods to help neuroscientists translate information at different levels of organization, like gene expression to neuron electrophysiology. Our long-term goal is to better understand the cellular changes that underlie psychiatric and neurological disorders and to ultimately develop approaches that can help guide tailored treatments to mental health patients.

<p>About Shreejoy Tripathy:</p>
  
<p>
I am an Independent Scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto. 

Before arriving at CAMH/U of T, I did my Post-Doc with Paul Pavlidis at the University of British Columbia, where I worked on integrating neuron electrophysiology with cell type-specific gene expression. I got my PhD in Neural Computation from Carnegie Mellon University in 2013, working with Nathan Urban. My PhD thesis was on computational and neuroinformatics methods for studying the electrophysiological diversity of neurons and neuron types throughout the brain.
