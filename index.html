<h1>Welcome to the Tripathy Lab!</h1> 

<br>
<p>
We are a computational genomics group passionate about understanding the brain at every scale, from genes to neurons to circuits, and using these insights to transform mental health care. Based at the <a href="https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics">Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics</a> and the University of Toronto, we combine advanced computational tools, machine learning, and single-cell genomics to study the incredible diversity of brain cell types and their role in health and disease.
<br> <br>
Our research bridges genetics, gene expression, and cell physiology, developing methods that translate findings across these disparate levels of organization. By uncovering the cellular roots of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease, we aim to guide tailored treatments that directly improve patient care.
<br> <br>
As a computational “dry lab,” we don’t conduct experiments in-house, but we collaborate extensively with leading experimental groups in Toronto and worldwide. Inspired by breakthroughs in precision medicine like in cancer, we’re aiming to build a future where mental health treatments are targeted to the unique biology of each individual. At the heart of our work is a vibrant, inclusive lab culture that thrives on curiosity, never-ending learning, and the shared goal of changing lives through science.</p>

About Shreejoy Tripathy: <br>I am a Scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, Department of Physiology, and the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Toronto. Before arriving in Toronto, I did my Post-Doc with 
          <a href="https://pavlab.msl.ubc.ca//">Paul Pavlidis</a>
          at the University of British Columbia, where I worked on integrating neuron electrophysiology with cell type-specific gene expression. I got my PhD in Neural Computation from Carnegie Mellon University in 2013, working with 
  <a href="https://www.nathanurbanlab.com/">Nathan Urban</a>. 
  My PhD thesis was on computational and neuroinformatics methods for studying the electrophysiological diversity of neurons throughout the brain.
