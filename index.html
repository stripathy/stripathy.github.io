<h1>Welcome to the Tripathy Lab!</h1> 

<br>
<p>We aim to develop a multi-scale understanding of brain cell type diversity, bridging genetics and gene expression with cell and circuit physiology. We develop machine learning and statistical methods to help neuroscientists translate information at different levels of organization, like gene expression to neuron electrophysiology. Our long-term goal is to better understand the cellular changes that underlie psychiatric and neurological disorders and to ultimately develop approaches that can help guide tailored treatments for mental health patients.
<br>
<p>Our lab is part of the new <a href="https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics">Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics</a>, where we contribute to the building of large-scale computational simulations of the nervous system. We are a computational “dry-lab”, but we collaborate extensively with experimental groups in Toronto and beyond. </p>

About Shreejoy Tripathy: <br>I am an Independent Scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto. Before arriving in Toronto, I did my Post-Doc with 
          <a href="https://pavlab.msl.ubc.ca//">Paul Pavlidis</a>
          at the University of British Columbia, where I worked on integrating neuron electrophysiology with cell type-specific gene expression. I got my PhD in Neural Computation from Carnegie Mellon University in 2013, working with 
  <a href="https://www.nathanurbanlab.com/">Nathan Urban</a>. 
  My PhD thesis was on computational and neuroinformatics methods for studying the electrophysiological diversity of neurons throughout the brain.
