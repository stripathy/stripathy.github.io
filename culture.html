     <h4>I want the lab culture to embody the following 3 basic principles:</h4>
     <ul>
     <li>
         <b>Embrace diversity</b> - I want our lab to be a diverse place, reflecting a mix of genders, nationalities, backgrounds, skill sets, etc. 
         Lab members are first and foremost expected to treat colleagues, collaborators, and our research subjects (human and otherwise) with respect. 
         A longer diversity statement written by Shreejoy to support his faculty applications is available 
          <a href="">here</a>.
     <br>
     <li>
         <b>Work should be fun and enjoyable</b> - I want to foster an environment where lab members can look forward to coming to each day. 
         I will do my best to ensure that every lab member has the freedom to express their own creativity and can work on the projects that are most meaningful to them. 
         Alsoâ€¦ be prepared for the occasional nerf gun fight.
     <br>
     <li>
         <b>Scientific rigour before impact</b> - The work we do should be rigorous - this is much more important than the journals we publish in. 
         All lab members are expected to learn and use good statistical practice and to not cut corners for the sake of getting a significant p-value or to please a collaborator. 
         If you have questions about whether a specific analysis is appropropriate, you should discuss it with Shreejoy.
