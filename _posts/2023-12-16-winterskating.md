  TripLab goes ice skating at Nathan Phillips Square
---

For our winter social event, the lab went ice skating at Toronto's iconic Nathan Phillips Square! Falling on the ice didn't stop us from having a great time. Shreejoy learned that while skating backwards is a great way to take lab photos, he isn't quite good enough at it to avoid completely running into people.

Huge thanks to Dan for hosting us all at his place afterwards and thanks to Dan's partner Luba for making a yummy DNA-themed cake!
