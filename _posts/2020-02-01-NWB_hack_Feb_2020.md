Shreejoy and Young worked with experimentalists and software developers on a [hackathon project](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons/HCK07_2020_Seattle/projects/icephys_meta_analysis/) to make it much easier for labs to convert their intracellular ephys datasets to the Neurodata Without Borders file format and perform feature extraction using standardized tools and pipelines developed at the Allen Institute.
