  TripLab lab cottage retreat to the Muskoka Region
---

The lab had its first ever lab retreat at a lake cottage in the beautiful Muskoka region of Southern Ontario! 
We had a great time of hiking, cooking, hanging out around a camp fire. Lots of silliness and nerdy conversations and it was a welcome relief after a hard year-plus of lockdown.
