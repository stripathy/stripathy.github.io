  Lab beach outing to Toronto Island / Michael gets a job!
---

The lab enjoyed a summer outing to the beach at Toronto Island, a short ferry ride from Downtown Toronto. We enjoyed hanging out, playing games, and eating burritos. We also celebrated Michael moving onto to start his new lab at [Mt. Sinai Hospital in Toronto](https://wainberglab.org/)!

We also got caught in a brief but intense hailstorm prior to returning from the beach. While it was an awful experience at the time, it will hopefully make for a great story in the future.
