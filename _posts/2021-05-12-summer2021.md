Summer 2021 brings many new changes to the lab and the lab is excited to welcome Keon Arbabi, a new Institute of Medical Science PhD student! 
The lab also welcomes January Yue, Ben Xu, and Diana Nelles, three undergraduate students who are interning in the lab over the summer term on a number of bioinformatics projects.

The lab is looking forward to an exciting summer of science and fun! Shreejoy in particular is looking forward to pandemic-safe outdoor summer activities with the lab.
