  TripLab welcomes Isabel, Kara, and Jessie!
---

Fall 2020 brings many new changes to the lab and the lab is excited to welcome Isabel Kerrebijn, a new Institute of Medical Science MSc student. 
The lab also welcomes Kara Han and Jessie Lam, two undergraduate students completing their Bioinformatics and Computational Biology 3rd year research credit term in the lab.

Despite the challenges of the pandemic, the lab continues to operate while everyone is working from home.
