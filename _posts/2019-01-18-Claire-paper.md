  Claire's paper on gene expression correlates of neuron ephys and morpho is now out on [biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/01/18/524561)! In my view, this marks the best attempt to quantitatively link gene expression, neuron ephys, and morphology using the newest datasets available today.
