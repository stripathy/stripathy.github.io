  TripLab celebrates Jiaming's graduation and meets Shreejoy's baby
---

The lab celebrated Jiaming's undergraduate graduation from UofT with a celebration in Christie Pits Park. Jiaming is off to start her PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in the lab of Joe Gleeson at UCSD! 

The lab also got to meet Shreejoy's new baby, Ophira, and his wife, Ilana. Thomas, lab chef extrodinaire, made an amazing pot of chili and corn bread from scratch to share with the lab.
