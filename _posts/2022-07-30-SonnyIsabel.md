  Sonny gets a (real) job! Isabel graduates!
---

Sonny, Shreejoy's first hire, recently moved on from his post-doc role in TripLab to a bioinformatics staff scientist position at Genentech / Roche. The lab celebrated by having burritos in at Christie Pitts and then going out for karoke. A few weeks later, Isabel Kerrebijn successfully defended her masters thesis! Isabel's moving onto a Data Science role at a Physiology startup.
