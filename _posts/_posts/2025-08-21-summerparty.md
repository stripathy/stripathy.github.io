  TripLab Summer Party at Shreejoy's House
---

The lab had a great summer-end party at Shreejoy's house. The lab also said bye to Dan Kiss, TripLab's lab manager over 2.5 years. He will be missed sorely.

Thomas, grad student and resident lab chef, made an amazing meal of veggie burritos that were loved by all, including Shreejoy's baby.
