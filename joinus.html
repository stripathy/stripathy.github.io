     <h4>Postdoctoral fellowships:</h4>
     <ul>
     <li>
       We are looking for a computational Post-Doc with a background in Bioinformatics or Computational Neuroscience 
         to lead a project relating human genetics to single cell transcriptomics and neuronal electrophysiology and morphology. 
         See the full description <a href="/docs/triplab_dry_lab_postdoc.pdf">here</a>.
      <br>
     <li>
         Jointly with the <a href="http://www.neurontobrainlaboratory.ca/">Valiante Lab</a>, 
          we are seeking a Post-Doc with expertise in Patch-Clamp Electrophysiology. The fellow will lead an innovative project 
          to study the physiology of human cortical neurons resected during epilepsy neurosurgery.
         See the full description <a href="/docs/valiante_human_ephys.pdf">here</a>.
      <br>
     </ul>
<h4>Graduate students:</h4>
     <ul>
     <li>We are currently looking for Masters and PhD students. The ideal student would have some familiarity with 
          programming and data analysis or have a strong desire to learn. Experience collecting real experimental data
          in neuroscience or molecular biology is also a plus.
          Interested students can apply through the <a href="https://ims.utoronto.ca/home/">Institute of Medical Science</a> 
          and should coordinate their application with Shreejoy by 
          email (<a href="mailto:shreejoy.tripathy@camh.ca">shreejoy.tripathy@camh.ca</a>).
     <li> Shreejoy is also available to serve on the thesis committees of graduate students at the University of Toronto.
          </ul>
        
<h4>Undergraduate students:</h4>
     <ul>
     <li>
  We are also looking for undergraduate students with some experience in programming and data analysis.
    Interested students should contact Shreejoy with a few sentences outlining their interests and a list of relevant coursework. 
</ul>
